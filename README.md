## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Inside

| Notebook | Focus Area |
|:--------:|:------------|
| `basic-checkpoint.ipynb` | Getting started: print, input, arithmetic |
| `function_if_else-checkpoint.ipynb` | Functions combined with `ifâ€‘else` logic |
| `if else condition-checkpoint.ipynb` | Conditional statements and decision flows |
| `list-checkpoint.ipynb` | Python lists: indexing, slicing, methods |
| `tuple_list-checkpoint.ipynb` | Tuple basics and difference with lists |
| `string-checkpoint.ipynb` | String operations: formatting, splitting |
| `string_everything-checkpoint.ipynb` | Advanced string tasks: parsing and manipulation |
| `sumNarrayNmatrix-checkpoint.ipynb` | Summation and loopâ€‘based matrix handling |
| `matrix-checkpoint.ipynb` | Matrix operations using nested loops |
| `loop-checkpoint.ipynb` | `for` loops, `while` loops, loop control |
| `myage-checkpoint.ipynb` | A simple project: calculate age using input |
| `name split-checkpoint.ipynb` | Splitting a full name into first/middle/last components |
| `typeconversion-checkpoint.ipynb` | Type casting across `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool` |

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Teach Python fundamentals in a guided, interactive way.
- Encourage consistent practice via discrete checkpoints.
- Handsâ€‘on learning with embedded code cells â€” ideal for beginners.

---

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- **Python 3.x** (recommend â‰¥3.8)
- **Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab**
- Installed via:
  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install notebook
  # or
  python3 -m pip install jupyterlab
````

---

## ðŸ§ª How to Use

1. **Clone the repo**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SouravMukharjee/myPyhton.git
   cd myPyhton
   ```

2. **Launch a notebook environment**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook     # or jupyter lab
   ```

3. **Open any `.ipynb`, read the problem brief (markdown cell), and run code cells interactively.**

4. Use the following approach for active learning:

   * Try duplicating a notebook and modifying it.
   * Add new test cases or implement corner-case handling.
   * Explore errors directly and learn with handsâ€‘on debugging.

5. *(Optional)* Convert a notebook to a Python script to study the plain `.py` logic:

   ```bash
   jupyter nbconvert --to script sumNarrayNmatrix-checkpoint.ipynb
   ```

## ðŸ§­ Suggested Learning Order

This sequence introduces concepts gradually:

```
basic â†’ if-else condition â†’ function_if_else â†’ list â†’ tuple_list â†’
string â†’ string_everything â†’ sumNarrayNmatrix â†’ matrix â†’ loop â†’
myage â†’ name split â†’ typeconversion
```

---

## âœ… Best Practices

* Maintain consistent variable names and code formatting.
* Add comments to explain your logic.
* Share your completed notebooks, new checkpoints, or scripts via pull requests.
* Re-run your notebook after edits to confirm behavior persists.
